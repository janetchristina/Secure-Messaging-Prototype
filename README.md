# Secure-Messaging-Prototype
This project involves implementing a two-party protocol between Alice and Bob in a way that the communication between them provides confidentiality and integrity using the cryptographic techniques.

Five tasks were implemented in total.

1. Digital Signature - 'signatures.py'
Alice and Bob each generate RSA key pairs. Messages exchanged in Diffieâ€“Hellman are signed and verified to prevent MITM attacks. Functions used are generate_keys(), sign_message(), verify_signature()

2. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange - 'diffie_helman.py'
Both parties compute the shared secret. Signatures ensure the authenticity of exchanged values. This is implemented using the function diffie_hellman_key_exchange()

3. Key Derivation Function - 'kdf.py'
Using the function derive_key(), the shared secret is iteratively hashed to derive a strong session key. 

4. Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) - 'prng.py'
A simple seeded PRNG generates random IV/nonce values for symmetric encryption. This was achieved by using SimplePRNG class with seed(), reseed(), generate()

5. Secure Message Exchange - 'encryption.py'
AES (CBC mode) provides confidentiality.  
HMAC-SHA256 ensures message integrity.  
Bob verifies the MAC before decryption.
Functions implemented are sym_enc(), sym_dec(), compute_hmac(), authenticated_encrypt(), authenticated_decrypt()
